Write me a django-html file with static file enabled.

On upper, there is a bar that has a logo on the left, it has dashboard, memberships, and metrics.
On the right side of the bar, there is a profile icon that when clicked, it shows a dropdown with settings and logout.
If user is logged out, it will show the modal for login and signup. 
if logged in as admin, it will redirect to dashboard.

you can use css and js files from static/core/ folder. use style.css and script.js file names.

The name of the project is GyMMS or Gym Membership Management System.
